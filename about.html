			<h4> My name is Dhruvi Mehta, I am from Singapore. I graduated high school in 2019 from UWCSEA east, and am currently a Communication Design student at the Parsons School of Design in New York City. I have grown up in an environment where art and artists have been appreciated. My late grandfather, a scientist by profession, was very creative and passionate about different forms of art such as visual arts, music, theatre, and dancing. He always insisted that art should be an everyday activity as it instills self-esteem. My mother loves to spend time painting (non-professional) and sees it as a form of self-expression. My mother and grandfather's thoughts and actions have played a significant role in initiating my interest in art. I am keen to take on this opportunity to explore the city and gain inspiration to create new art. I really enjoy working with motion graphics, web-deisgn and even package design. I am always open to learn about new places, concepts and technieques, please feel free to reach out!
